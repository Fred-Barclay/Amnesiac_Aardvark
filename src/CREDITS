Amnesiac Aardvark is the work of many `varks, including but not limited to:

Cooper Quintin, Yan Zhu, Dan Auerbach, Noah Swartz, Garrett Robinson, Peter
Eckersley, Jonathan Mayer, Franzi Roesner, Alexei Miagkov, Gunes Acar, Mária
Jurčovičová, Thorsten Sick, Doug Yun, Monica Chew, PiRSquared17, Jacob
Hoffman-Andrews, Jeremy Gillula, Mr Shu, and Fred Barclay.

Most of all, Amnesiac Aardvark owes the Electronic Freedom Frontier and the
Privacy Badger extension for Firefox. Without their dedication and hard work
on the Privacy Badger project, we wouldn't be here today.
